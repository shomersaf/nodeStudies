1. Protect the Create Product API - only if user have valid token
valid = token sent from user + token exist in tokens array
2. Advanced - Protect all your application except - login/sign up

# HW 21-6 - author comments:
1. The token is hardcoded in login (and it is number 11), because any generated token won't be relevant for the tests like that.
2. The postman test requests collection is added in the "postman" folder 
3. I didn't add the tests for another entry points, because there wasn't task like that in HW describtion
